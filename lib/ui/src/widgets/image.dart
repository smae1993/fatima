  /// A builder that specifies the widget to display to the user while an image
  /// is still loading.
  ///
  /// If this is null, and the image is loaded incrementally (e.g. over a
  /// network), the user will receive no indication of the progress as the
  /// bytes of the image are loaded.
  ///
  /// For more information on how to interpret the arguments that are passed to
  /// this builder, see the documentation on [ImageLoadingBuilder].
  ///
  /// ## Performance implications
  ///
  /// If a [loadingBuilder] is specified for an image, the [Image] widget is
  /// likely to be rebuilt on every
  /// [rendering pipeline frame](rendering/RendererBinding/drawFrame.html) until
  /// the image has loaded. This is useful for cases such as displaying a loading
  /// progress indicator, but for simpler cases such as displaying a placeholder
  /// widget that doesn't depend on the loading progress (e.g. static "loading"
  /// text), [frameBuilder] will likely work and not incur as much cost.
  ///
  /// ## Chaining with [frameBuilder]
  ///
  /// If a [frameBuilder] has _also_ been specified for an image, the two
  /// builders will be chained together: the `child` argument to this
  /// builder will contain the _result_ of the [frameBuilder]. For example,
  /// consider the following builders used in conjunction:
  ///
  /// {@macro flutter.widgets.Image.frameBuilder.chainedBuildersExample}
  ///
  /// {@tool dartpad}
  /// The following sample uses [loadingBuilder] to show a
  /// [CircularProgressIndicator] while an image loads over the network.
  ///
  /// ** See code in examples/api/lib/widgets/image/image.loading_builder.0.dart **
  /// {@end-tool}
  ///
  /// Run against a real-world image on a slow network, the previous example
  /// renders the following loading progress indicator while the image loads
  /// before rendering the completed image.
  ///
  /// {@animation 400 400 https://flutter.github.io/assets-for-api-docs/assets/widgets/loading_progress_image.mp4}

  /// middle of the bottom edge of its layout bounds.
  ///
  /// To display a subpart of an image, consider using a [CustomPainter] and
  /// [Canvas.drawImageRect].
  ///
  /// If the [alignment] is [TextDirection]-dependent (i.e. if it is a
  /// [AlignmentDirectional]), then an ambient [Directionality] widget
  /// must be in scope.
  ///
  /// Defaults to [Alignment.center].

  ///    relative to text direction.

  /// only horizontally and the region of the image to the left and right of
  /// the center slice will be stretched only vertically.

  /// images); and in [TextDirection.rtl] contexts, the image will be drawn with
  /// a scaling factor of -1 in the horizontal direction so that the origin is
  /// in the top right.
  ///
  /// This is occasionally used with images in right-to-left environments, for
