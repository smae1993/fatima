# Fatima Flutter Kit

Is a library to reduce production time and easy to use for beginners.

It contains **UI** and **StateManagement** and **Navigation** and **Storage** ( like android Shared Preferences ) tools.

So it is a light weight and full kit for production.


It works beside **Material** and **Cupertino** libraries. so for preventing any conflicts, we suggest to use **ui** elements like this :

```dart
 import 'package:fatima/ui/fatima_ui.dart' as ui;



 // usage of ui
 ui.Button(title:"simple Button");
```
